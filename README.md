Make a photo rating app. Photos would be displayed in a slideshow form, allowing users to input a range of numbers or an alpha Beta keyboard. This would allow them to create folders for each photo allowing them to sort their photos just by looking at the picture. This could also implement speech recognition. My specific use would be for organizing pornography photos by rank and number. Pinch zoom select drag.
